# Basic miner for POW NFT

Just the core functionality of the POW NFT miner. 

Intended as a starting point for anyone who wants to make their own, or just learn how it works.

Note: MetaMask doesn't like playing with non-https sites, so you'll probs wanna do some kind of local testing webserver stuff.

# The yawnson miner

A POW NFT community member going only by the name *yawnson* has shared their miner code. It's not a fork of this code, but is far more efficient.

You may see their repo here:
