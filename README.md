# Basic miner for POW NFT

Just the core functionality of the POW NFT miner. 

Intended as a starting point for anyone who wants to make their own, or just learn how it works.

Note: MetaMask doesn't like playing with non-https sites, so you'll probs wanna do some kind of local testing webserver stuff.

# The yawnson miner

A POW NFT community member going only by the name *yawnson* has shared their miner code. It's not a fork of my code, but is far more efficient.

If you're going to use it, I suggest you vet the code yourself first for security reasons, but this outperforms my code by orders of magnitude. I've implemented some of their changes in the site miner, and will be adding more of them down the track.

You can see their repo here:
